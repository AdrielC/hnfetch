WIP notes

Need to improve error handling in the both ZIO and Cats effect versions

Would be nice to add comment printing from zio hn fetch code

Blog post to show the interop between scalaz, cats, about how much fun it was

Refactor get multiple to allow multiple types of data sources if possible

eg take a Task[List[?]] ???
