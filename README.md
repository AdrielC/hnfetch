## Using Scala to interact with the Hacker News API

This is a simple program written to supplement a blog post on using Scala to access Hacker News users and stories.

[Hacker News API Part 1](http://justinhj.github.io/2017/07/26/hacker-news-api-1.html)

By running the main program you can view a text version of the Hacker News front page in your terminal (or IDE output).

Usage `sbt run 0` shows the first 10 items

`sbt run 1` shows the next 10 items and so on
